# PackageHook
Hook An Android Applications Package Config And Set It As You Want.

Inside of [build.gradle](https://github.com/jbro129/PackageHook/blob/master/PackageHook/app/build.gradle) the versionCode, versionName, and applicationId are set.

You can change the versionCode, versionName, and applicationId (another name for packageName) to whatever you like as done inside of [here](https://github.com/jbro129/PackageHook/blob/master/PackageHook/app/src/main/java/com/jbro129/packagehook/MainApp.java)

Why?
-------
By changing the versionCode, versionName, and applicationId you can use Google Play In-App Purchases even when the info is not the same as declared in the Google Play Developer Console.
